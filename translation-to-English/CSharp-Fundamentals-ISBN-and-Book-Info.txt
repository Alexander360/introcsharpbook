Book Description
----------------

The free book "Fundamentals of Computer Programming with C#" (http://www.introprogramming.info) is a comprehensive computer programming tutorial that teaches programming, logical thinking, data structures and algorithms, problem solving and high quality code with lots of examples in C#. It comes with free video lessons, presentations, exercises and solutions.

This free programming tutorial starts with the first steps in programming and software development like variables, data types, conditional statements, loops and arrays and continues with other basic topics like methods, numeral systems, strings and string processing, exceptions, classes and objects.

After the basics this free fundamental programming book enters into more advanced programming topics like recursion, data structures (lists, trees, hash-tables and graphs), high-quality code, unit testing and refactoring, object-oriented principles (inheritance, abstraction, encapsulation and polymorphism) and their implementation in the C# language. It also covers fundamental topics that each good developer should know like algorithm design, complexity of algorithms and problem solving.

This free programming book uses C# language and Visual Studio to illustrate the programming concepts and explains some C# / .NET specific technologies like lambda expressions, extension methods and LINQ. This free programming C# book is written by a team of developers lead by Svetlin Nakov (http://www.nakov.com) who has 20+ years practical software development experience and 10+ years as software development trainer.

This free book on fundamentals of programming teaches the major programming concepts and way of thinking needed to become a good software engineer and the C# language in the meantime. It is a great start for anyone who wants to become a skillful software engineer. The books does not teach technologies like databases, mobile and web development, but shows the true way to master the basics of programming regardless of the languages, technologies and tools. It is good for beginners and intermediate developers who want to put a solid base for a successful career in the software engineering industry. The book is accompanied by 27 free video lessons on C# programming (42 hours), presentation slides (27 PPTX presentations) and mind maps, as well as hundreds of exercises with solutions and live examples.
